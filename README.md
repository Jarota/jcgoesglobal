# JC Goes Global


This is the code for the personal website [jcgoes.global](https://jcgoes.global).


After spending some time improving my frontend skills (via [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com)), this is a full-stack app I built to keep myself sharp while we were traveling for the latter half of 2025. It is a bespoke, travel, mini-blog, for my partner and I to upload photos of our travels.


I haven't uploaded as much as I'd like - I had more fun developing the app than using it ...

## Learnings

A list of tech I used and learned about over the course of this project (so far):
